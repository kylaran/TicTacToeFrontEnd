We have crafted a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily browse open games, play with friends and bots, view game history, as well as customize game settings such as board size and win conditions. Our frontend utilizes methods, events, and buttons of Telegram Mini App to ensure convenient interaction with the familiar Telegram interface.
